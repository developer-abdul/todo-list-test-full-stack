This is a full stack project for a Todo App Done By Abdul Ghani Raheem

## Getting Started

The task I have acheived from Front-End

- user is able to add new task to the list
- user is able to delete any task from the list
- user is able to search through the tasks (by name)
- user is able to mark task as done or not done

The task I have acheived from Back-End

Created the API to support:
- By default list has only 1 task: (title “Create todo list”, status: done);
- add new task in the list
- get tasks list (with search)
- delete task from the list
- update task (mark done/not done)
